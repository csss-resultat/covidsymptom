## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Worked to fix the errors on Solaris (0 issues on rhub::check_on_solaris()) 
* Changed some dependencies

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.0.3
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.3
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is a new release.
